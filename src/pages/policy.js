              <h5>Microblading Touch-Ups</h5>
              <p>
                All Microblading procedures require two touch-up sessions 6-8
                weeks apart. This touchup is crucial for the best results. It is
                the clientâ€™s responsibility to book a follow-up appointment 6 to
                8 weeks after first treatment. Anything longer than eight weeks
                is subject to a set up tray fee of $200. No-show for second
                session appointment will automatically be forfeited. Additional
                touch-up appointments may be needed for oily, problematic skin,
                and those who do not follow after care instructions properly at
                an additional fee.

                <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> Microblading is a multiple-step
                appointment process. Healed results will vary with each
                individual client, and due to the nature of the procedure, NO
                guarantees will be made. Additional sessions (at an additional
                charge) may be required to obtain optimal desired results.
                Although we give our best efforts to provide you with quality
                service, many factors can result in a less than desired outcome
                as each client will heal differently. In order for your new
                brows to heal properly (and look their very best) following all
                Pre & Post Care Instructions is crucial! Pre Care Instructions
                are designed to limit bleeding and skin sensitivities during the
                service. Excessive bleeding during the procedure can dilute and
                expel the pigment color and lead to poor results. Brows are NOT
                meant to stay as dark as they initially appear immediately after
                procedure. Your brows are gradually and continuously getting
                lighter as your skin is always naturally regenerating and
                exfoliating itself. Yearly color boost are recommended to keep
                your brows looking their best.
